## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Olivia Freund, and I am a senior Economics, Business Analytics, and Computer Science student at the University of Northern Iowa. 
I am currently working on creating a website for the company I work for using html, css, and javaScript! Any other projects I've worked on you can find in 
my repository. I am very passionate about data analytics and emerging technology, and am in the process of searching for a job in software development to kick-start my career after graduation. 
You can contact me at freundo@uni.edu or [linkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/olivia-freund-91a197252/)
